Okay, here you go, my profile page. My fullname is Nguyễn Phước Thạch, born in Da Nang, Vietnam, my hometown is a small, beautiful beachside city. People is slowly living, food is cheap, and travel services is good.

Well, i'm 26 now, still single, hmmm ... when someone is single at my age in my country, he is kind of loser to his parents and relative. I think i'll get a girl soon, or my 3-year younger brother will get his wedding before me.

About myself information, i think it's not easy to understand someone with just some description written by himself/herself. We need to talk, to hear comments from people around him/her. I'm gonna talk about my hobbies or some daily activities.

In my free time, i love watching Japanese anime, manga, this hobby take my time a lot, so i'm trying to focus or ... practiced meditation. I took myself some Japanese class for this hobby, but after 5 years from when i start, i still can not watching anime without Viet-sub, damn it.

My second hobby is traveling, not in luxury way, i prefer natural sights to old ruin or modern building. My country is a fantastic place to travel, both in natural sights and foods. I try to have 1 internal trip and 1 external trip every year, but this year, 2020, corona virus block almost external flights.
